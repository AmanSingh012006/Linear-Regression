Advertising Dataset Project

This project demonstrates the application of Linear Regression to predict sales based on advertising expenditure across three different media channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The project follows a complete machine learning workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is advertising.csv.

It contains the following columns:

TV: Advertising budget spent on TV (in thousands of dollars).

Radio: Advertising budget spent on Radio (in thousands of dollars).

Newspaper: Advertising budget spent on Newspaper (in thousands of dollars).

Sales: Sales generated (in thousands of units).

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries

The project is implemented in Python using:

pandas – Data handling

numpy – Numerical computations

matplotlib – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning (train-test split, Linear Regression)

🚀 Project Workflow

Data Loading: Imported advertising.csv using pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Checked dataset shape, structure, and basic statistics.

Explored relationships between features and sales.

Data Splitting:

Separated dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Building:

Applied Linear Regression using scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance on the test set.

Plotted predicted vs actual sales.

📊 Results

The Linear Regression model shows a clear relationship between advertising spend and sales.

TV and Radio are stronger predictors compared to Newspaper.

Visualization confirms that the regression line fits the data trends effectively.

📌 Future Improvements

Try other models (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest).

Perform feature engineering for better insights.

Apply cross-validation for more robust results.

Add interactive visualizations.
